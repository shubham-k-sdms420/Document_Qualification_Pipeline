# Document Quality Verification Pipeline

A comprehensive, modular system for automatically verifying the quality of government documents (No Dues Certificates, NOC Documents, Index II) before processing them with LLMs. This system runs entirely on local infrastructure with zero ongoing costs.

## 🎯 Overview

This pipeline automatically filters out low-quality documents before they reach your LLM for processing, saving money, improving accuracy, and reducing manual review work.

### What This System Does

- **Accepts**: Readable documents (OCR can extract text), printed text, documents with signatures/stamps, scanned documents (even if slightly blurry but readable)
- **Rejects**: Truly unreadable documents (OCR cannot read), handwritten documents, dark/washed-out scans, low resolution images, documents that cannot be processed by LLM
- **Features**: 
  - Single document upload with detailed stage-by-stage analysis
  - **Bulk upload** - Process up to 50 documents at once with summary results
  - **Multi-page PDF processing** - Processes all pages and evaluates based on best page or content page (page 2 for 2-page documents)
  - **URL-based processing** - Download and process documents from URLs (for RTS API integration)
  - **Swagger API documentation** - Interactive API docs at `/api/docs`
  - **Florence-2 integration** - Optional AI-powered handwriting verification to reduce false positives

**Key Principle**: If OCR can read the document (≥ 50% confidence), it's accepted even if image quality metrics are lower. Readability is prioritized over perfect image quality.

### Benefits

- **50-60% cost reduction** in LLM API costs
- **70-80% reduction** in manual review workload
- **Better accuracy** from higher quality inputs
- **Clear feedback** to users about document issues
- **100% local processing** - no API keys or cloud services required

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system uses a 4-stage cascading filter. Each stage is faster and cheaper than the next. Documents must pass ALL stages to be accepted.

### Stage 1: Basic Quality Checks (OpenCV)

- **Processing Time**: 50-100ms
- **Checks**: Resolution, Blur, Brightness, Contrast, White Space, Skew, Corruption
- **Status Logic**: Stage passes if no critical failures (warnings don't cause failure)
- **Rejects**: 20-30% of uploads

### Stage 2: OCR Confidence Analysis (Tesseract)

- **Processing Time**: 2-5 seconds
- **Checks**: Text readability, Confidence scores, Text regions, Character count
- **Rejects**: 30-40% of documents that passed Stage 1

### Stage 3: Handwriting Detection (Computer Vision)

- **Processing Time**: 0.5-2 seconds
- **Checks**: Stroke width variance, Baseline variance, Character spacing, Connected components
- **Rejects**: 10-20% of documents that passed Stage 2
- **Florence-2 Integration**: Optional AI-powered verification to reduce false positives (e.g., bold text)

### Stage 4: Overall Quality Score (BRISQUE)

- **Processing Time**: 100-200ms
- **Checks**: Blind image quality assessment
- **Rejects**: 5-10% of documents that passed Stage 3

## 📊 Quality Score Calculation

The final quality score (0-100) is calculated using a weighted formula:

```
Quality Score = (Stage 1 × 0.35) +
                (Stage 2 × 0.40) +
                (Stage 3 × 0.20) +
                (Stage 4 × 0.05)
```

### Score Thresholds

- **≥ 70**: Accept (or ≥ 60 with leniency)
- **50-69**: Flag for review (unless OCR is high - see below)
- **< 50**: Reject

### Lenient Acceptance for Readable Documents

The system prioritizes **readability** over perfect image quality:

- **OCR ≥ 80%**: Accept with score ≥ 55 (very readable documents)
- **OCR ≥ 60%**: Accept with score ≥ 60 (readable documents)
- **OCR ≥ 50%**: Blur/handwriting false positives are filtered (readable despite image quality issues)
- **Standard**: Score ≥ 70 (or ≥ 60 with leniency)

**Rationale**: If OCR can read the document, it can be processed by LLM, even if image quality metrics are imperfect.

## 🧪 Testing

Test the system with sample documents from the `Documents/` folder:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Test with a sample document
python -c "
from src.pipeline.orchestrator import PipelineOrchestrator
orchestrator = PipelineOrchestrator()
result = orchestrator.process_document('Documents/No_Dues1.pdf')
print(result)
"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Tesseract Not Found

```bash
# Install Tesseract OCR
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

# Verify installation
tesseract --version
```

### Poppler Not Found

```bash
# Install Poppler
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

# Verify installation
pdftoppm -h
```

### Import Errors

Make sure you've activated the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Port Already in Use

Change the port in `.env`:

```
FLASK_PORT=5001
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Based on testing with government documents:

- **Processing Time**: 3-8 seconds per document
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ correct decisions
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% (good docs rejected) - improved with OCR-based filtering
- **False Negative Rate**: < 5% (bad docs accepted)
- **Final Acceptance Rate**: 50-55% reach LLM (increased due to better handling of scanned documents)
- **Cost Savings**: 50-60% LLM cost reduction

## 🔄 Recent Improvements (December 2025)

### OCR Confidence as Primary Signal

- **Blur Rejection**: Now only rejects for blur if OCR confidence is also low (< 30%). If OCR ≥ 50%, blur becomes a warning, not a rejection.
- **Readability First**: System prioritizes whether OCR can read the document over perfect image quality metrics.

### Handwriting Detection Improvements

- **Blurry Scanned Documents**: Handwriting false positives are filtered when document is blurry but OCR can read it (≥ 50% confidence).
- **Signatures/Stamps**: Documents with concentrated handwriting (15-30%) are accepted if OCR ≥ 30% (reduced from 75% requirement).
- **Bold Text Handling**: Fixed false positives where bold text was misclassified as handwriting. System now trusts high OCR (≥ 80%) over handwriting detection for bold text cases.
- **Florence-2 Integration**: Optional AI-powered verification to reduce handwriting false positives. Only called when handwriting is detected but OCR is high (≥ 50%).

### Lenient Acceptance Logic

- **High OCR (≥ 80%)**: Accept with score ≥ 55, trust OCR over handwriting detection
- **Good OCR (≥ 60%)**: Accept with score ≥ 60
- **Readable OCR (≥ 50%)**: Filter out blur/handwriting false positives

### New Features

- **URL-Based Processing**: Download and process documents from URLs via `/api/process-url` and `/api/bulk-process-urls` endpoints
- **RTS API Integration**: Support for processing documents from external APIs (like RTS website)
- **Swagger Documentation**: Interactive API documentation at `/api/docs` for testing all endpoints
- **Enhanced Safeguards**: Multiple layers of protection to prevent accepting handwritten documents even with high OCR

| 30-49%    | ⚠️ FLAG FOR REVIEW | Marginal - needs review                             |
| 50-59%    | ✅ ACCEPTED          | Readable (filters blur/handwriting false positives) |
| 60-79%    | ✅ ACCEPTED          | Good readability                                    |
| ≥ 80%    | ✅ ACCEPTED          | Excellent readability (very lenient scoring)        |

### Configuration values (from .env)

```env
# Critical Thresholds
OCR_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD=25          # Reject if OCR < 25%

# Warning Thresholds
OCR_AVG_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=45    # Warning if OCR < 45%
OCR_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_WORDS=5        # Minimum high-confidence words
OCR_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_SCORE=70       # Word confidence threshold
OCR_MIN_TEXT_REGIONS=2             # Minimum text regions
OCR_MIN_CHARACTERS=30              # Minimum characters
```

### Decision flow

```
OCR Confidence Check:
├─ < 20% → ❌ REJECTED (Completely unreadable)
├─ < 25% → ❌ REJECTED (Critical failure)
├─ 25-29% → ⚠️ WARNING (Below recommended)
├─ 30-49% → ⚠️ FLAG FOR REVIEW (Marginal)
│   └─ With blur → Review (may need rescanning)
│   └─ With signatures → Review (low OCR)
├─ 50-59% → ✅ ACCEPTED (Readable)
│   └─ Filters blur/handwriting false positives
├─ 60-79% → ✅ ACCEPTED (Good readability)
│   └─ Accept with score ≥ 60
└─ ≥ 80% → ✅ ACCEPTED (Excellent)
    └─ Accept with score ≥ 55 (very lenient)
```

### Notes

1. Primary signal: OCR confidence is the primary readability indicator
2. Blur filtering: OCR ≥ 50% filters blur false positives
3. Handwriting filtering: OCR ≥ 50% filters handwriting false positives for blurry documents
4. Signature handling: OCR ≥ 30% accepts documents with signatures/stamps
5. Lenient acceptance: Higher OCR (≥ 80%) allows lower quality scores (≥ 55)

All thresholds are configurable via the .env file.

### Result

- Better handling of scanned documents that are readable but have imperfect image quality
- Reduced false rejections of good documents
- More accurate detection of signatures/stamps vs handwritten documents

## 🔗 URL-Based Processing (RTS API Integration)

The system supports processing documents from URLs, making it easy to integrate with external APIs like RTS website.

### Single Document from URL

```bash
POST /api/process-url
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://rts-website.com/api/document/123/download",
  "filename": "doc123"  // optional
}
```

### Bulk Processing from URLs

```bash
POST /api/bulk-process-urls
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "urls": [
    "https://rts-website.com/api/document/123/download",
    "https://rts-website.com/api/document/124/download"
  ],
  "filenames": ["doc123", "doc124"]  // optional
}
```

### Integration Example

```python
import requests

# Get document URLs from RTS API
rts_docs = requests.get("https://rts-website.com/api/documents").json()
urls = [doc['download_link'] for doc in rts_docs['documents']]

# Process through quality pipeline
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5000/api/bulk-process-urls",
    json={"urls": urls}
)
results = response.json()

# Filter accepted documents
accepted = [r for r in results['results'] if r['status'] == 'ACCEPTED']
```

### Configuration

```env
DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=downloads
DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT=30
```

## 🤖 Florence-2 Integration (Optional)

Florence-2 is an optional AI-powered component that helps reduce false positives in handwriting detection, especially for bold text cases.

### Installation

```bash
pip install torch transformers einops timm
```

### Enable

```env
FLORENCE_ENABLED=true
```

### How It Works

- **When Called**: Handwriting detected (≥ 20%) AND OCR confidence ≥ 50%
- **Purpose**: Verify if handwriting detection is a false positive (e.g., bold text)
- **Performance**: First document ~8-10 seconds (model loading), subsequent ~1-2 seconds
- **Memory**: ~2-3GB RAM

### Benefits

- Reduces false positives from bold text, formatting, and scanning artifacts
- Provides additional verification layer for borderline cases
- Modular component - can be enabled/disabled easily
